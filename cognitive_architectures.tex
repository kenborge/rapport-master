\section{Cognitive Architectures}
\label{sec:cogarch}
Cognitive architectures are architectures that base themselves on some model of
human cognition. There are several competing models of cognition, and one of
the most recent and well-supported is the Global Workspace Theory.

One area that haven't been as well explored in relation to RTSes in general and
StarCraft in particular, is cognitive architectures. Arrabales et al put forth
that this is perhaps because of poor understanding within the field of classical
AI of research into cognition\cite{arrabales2009gamechars}.

\subsection{Global Workspace Theory}

Global Workspace Theory is a model of cognition that is very well supported by
experimental data, and is one of the most widely accepted models.
\cite{dehaene2001towards} It has been used to implement processes that imitate
human decision making (for example for solving the problem of assigning people
to jobs in the US Navy).\cite{baars2005gwt}\cite{franklin2003interacting}

It is based around an understanding of the brain as a set of many independently
processing modules, working together by utilizing a shared workspace (hence the
``global workspace''). Every ``cognitive cycle'' all the
processes compete for attention, and a single one gets the
proverbial spotlight shone upon it.\cite{baars2005gwt}

There have been several implementations of GWT for different domains and
approaches, for example the LIDA (``Learning IDA'')
model\cite{franklin2007lida}, or the CERA-CRANIUM
architecture\cite{arrabales2009ceracranium}.

See figure \ref{fig:gwt} for an overview of the theory.

\subsubsection{Neurological basis for the Global Workspace Theory}
According to \cite{llinas1998neuronal}, the looped neural pathways between the
thalamus and the cortex might be what is responsible for the conscious
collaboration between various parts of the brain. The thalamus is responsible
for letting various parts of the cortex broadcast and influence the rest of the
cortex. This meshes well with the global workspace theory, and the idea of a
single subsystem broadcasting its contents to the rest of the whole.

There has also been discovered a link between the switching between coherent and
decohoerent EEG-activity that seems to indicate a switching between states of
competition for access to the global workspace. Decoherent electric activity
seems to indicate a competitive process, while coherent activity indicates a
passive ``listening''.\cite{freeman2003neurobiological}

The periods between these states is compatible with
the widely accepted figures for the time it takes for
stimulus to become conscious.\cite{shanahan2005applying}

Several studies have support the theory that consciousness is what enables
global activation. They usually compare conscious and unconscious conditions in
conscious subjects. Either by sensory stimulation or {\em overpractice of
automatic habits}, that is; consciously doing tasks that usually are done
unconsciously. All results show that conscious processes lead to widespread
cortical activation, while unconscious ones usually only activates local
regions.\cite{baars2003brain}

There has also been experiments done where subjects have been in various states
of unconsciousness (sleep, general anasthesia, epileptic loss of consciousness
and vegetative states), and it has been found that sensory stimulation in all
states only lead to local activation in the cortex.\cite{shanahan2005applying}

\subsection{Cognitive Models in Game AIs}
There have been several more or less successful attempts at implementing models
of cognition into game-playing agents. One of the more recent ones is
CERA-CRANIUM. One of the reasons for using computer games for experiments with regards to
high-level artificial intelligence is that the characteristics of computer
games lend themselves to this, by eliminating noise and uncertainty, and
providing a more or less realistic simulated environment.

\subsection{The LIDA Model}
The LIDA model is a cognitive model based on the GWT.
