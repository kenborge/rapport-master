\chapter{Introduction}
In this chapter we introduce our project, as well as the background and motivation for doing this. Section \ref{sec:background} presents the background and our motivation for the project, a short introduction to Starcraft and the API we will use and describes what we will do in this project and our main goals. Section \ref{sec:contributions} contains the main contributors to the project as well as our supervisors. Section \ref{sec:goals} explains the goals we hope to accomplish during the project. Section \ref{sec:structure} introduces the structure of this report.

\section{Background and Motivation}
\label{sec:background}
It is our opinion that the study of cognitive architectures are woefully underrepresented in the field of artificial intelligence, and also in the domain of computer games. We believe that the use of cognitive architectures should be further explored to attain a better understanding of the gains from using a cognitive architecture.

\section{Name}
\label{sec:name}
The name {\em Jantu} is hindi, and is translated as ``Pertaining to the merely sentient part of a creature, as distinguished from the intellectual, rational, or spiritual part; as, the animal passions or appetites.'', which reflects what we are trying to achieve with our work in this project.\cite{hindijantu}

\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:contributions}
Firstly we would also like to thank our supervisors; Helge Langseth and Anders Kofod-Petersen. We would also like to thank the Cognitive Computing Research Group at the University of Memphis, for their LIDA framework which is the basis of our project.

\section{Project goals}
\label{sec:goals}
First and foremost we set out to create a proof of concept agent that could play the game StarCraft: Brood War, built using a cognitive architecture.

Secondly we want to explore what problems one faces when using a cognitive architecture in this domain, but also what works well.

\section{Report Structure}
\label{sec:structure}
This report is structured into four chapters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Chapter 1: \textbf{Introduction} \\
This chapter describes the motivation and goal of the project as well as who
contributed and the general structure of the report.
\item Chapter 2: \textbf{Theory} \\
In this chapter we present the domain we're working in; the real-time computer strategy game StarCraft: Brood War. We also present the cognitive architecture we're using.
\item Chapter 3: \textbf{Implementation} \\
This chapter presents our implementation.
\item Chapter 4: \textbf{Results} \\
This chapter presents how our implementation performed.
\item Chapter 5: \textbf{Evaluation} \\
Here we summarize and evaluate the work presented in this report.
\item Chapter 6: \textbf{Future Work} \\
Here we give some ideas of what work is left, and where others can build on our project to make it better.

\end{itemize}
