\chapter{Theory}
In this chapter we will the present background theory that is important for our project. In Section \ref{sec:starcrafttheory}, we have a general explanation of the game, and also explain the BWAPI architecture and how it utilizes shared memory and JNI to allow bots written in Java. Section \ref{sec:cogarch} describes models of cognition, the theory behind them and some architectures/implementations. Section \ref{sec:lida} describes the LIDA model of cognition as well as the LIDA framework that implements this model computationally.
