\chapter{Evaluation}
In this chapter we conclude our work by looking at the goals defined in the
introduction, and evaluate the results.
Section \ref{sec:evalres} evaluates the results of the project.
Section \ref{sec:conclusion} contains the final conclusion for the project and this report. 
Section \ref{sec:futurework} contains our thoughts on future implementation and improvements of our solution.



\section{Evaluation of Results}
\label{sec:evalres}
Our motivation for this project was to create an agent, using LIDA, that could play StarCraft: Brood War, which we succeeded in. We also discovered some of the problems inherent in the use of this cognitive architecture for this domain.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We succeded in achieving what we set out to do, and while the performance was not excellent, we think it is a very good starting point for any future work in this area.

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futurework}
We believe that there are several areas to be worked on. Implementing more feature detectors, and more behaviours, might be the easiest and obvious way to go forward. Replacing the rule-based action selection module with a more advanced approach is also something to look into. Version 1.2 of the LIDA framework replaces the default rule-based action selection with a behaviour network, based on Maes' behaviour network.\cite{maes1989right}

A more significant change would be to use the various memory modules available more actively.\cite{franklin2007lida}. This could help with for example letting the bot remember more about the state of the game, for example if it has already built the necessary building necessary for a certain unit, or remember build orders (learned from earlier games).

Learning could also be implemented at several other levels, not just as long-term memory.
